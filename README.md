# Diffsync

<!--
Developer Note - Remove Me!

The README will have certain links/images broken until the PR is merged into `develop`. Update the GitHub links with whichever branch you're using (main etc.) if different.

The logo of the project is a placeholder (docs/images/icon-diffsync.png) - please replace it with your app icon, making sure it's at least 200x200px and has a transparent background!

To avoid extra work and temporary links, make sure that publishing docs (or merging a PR) is done at the same time as setting up the docs site on RTD, then test everything.

### Contributing to the Documentation

You can find all the Markdown source for the App documentation under the [`docs`](https://github.com/networktocode/diffsync/tree/develop/docs) folder in this repository. For simple edits, a Markdown capable editor is sufficient: clone the repository and edit away.

If you need to view the fully-generated documentation site, you can build it with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). A container hosting the documentation can be started using the `invoke` commands (details in the [Development Environment Guide](https://diffsync/dev/dev_environment/#docker-development-environment)) on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001). Using this container, as your changes to the documentation are saved, they will be automatically rebuilt and any pages currently being viewed will be reloaded in your browser.

Any PRs with fixes or improvements are very welcome!
